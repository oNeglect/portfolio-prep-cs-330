# How Do I Approach Designing Softare?
I have a variety of approaches that I use when designing software. One is that the best end result can only be produced by good setup of client requirements, awareness of the environment in which you are designing, and the creation of an environment where openness and honesty are of the utmost significance. I used my professor's and my students' resources as well as numerous tools on the internet to locate the solution as part of the design process I followed for my project. By understanding what the assignment demands, listing out requirements, and taking the design one step at a time, the strategies might be applied in more classes.

# How Do I Approach Developing Programs?
Utilizing the resources offered during the course, working with my professor, and developing a process that assisted me in meeting the requirements provided by the client in an effective and efficient manner were just a few of the new developmental strategies I used to develop programs while taking the course. Trial and error were fairly common during the project's building, which had an impact on iteration in my development. The key to its success was resolving the different problems within the IDE to aid in the creation of the end result. My approach to developing code changed throughout the milestones by proper implementation of libraries, proper understanding of client expectations, and refinding the understanding of the subject during that milestone heloped to create the end product effectively and efficiently.

# How Can Computer Science Help Me In Reaching My Goals?
The soft skills taught in the training will be highly useful to me no matter what career route I choose. Depending on where my life leads me, I can apply the soft skills of communication, patience, critical thinking, and openness to criticism to computer science. On a technical level, I want to be able to explain to people how writing clean code may help us produce a more effective product, whether they work with me or in a team. Although gaining new computational and visualization skills can be advantageous, the soft skills acquired far outweigh the technical skills gained from exposure to the language or environment. Nonetheless, these cannot be disregarded. I am incredibly appreciative to my lecturer and the other students in the class for teaching me so much.

# Ending
I am very grateful for the time in the course! Be well, professor! I hope you have a great rest of your day! Be safe!

Sincerely,

Lawrence
