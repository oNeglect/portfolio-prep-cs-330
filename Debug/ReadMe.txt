To run project, please use the following settings: I am very grateful for your help thus far! Take care Professor!

Steps:
1.Run the project in Debug Mode x86, was not able to run in any other mode unfortunately.
2.Change the settings for the Code Generation if needed- > How to get there:
Right click on project in solution explorer -> Navigate to C/C++ -> Code Generation

Hopefully the project will run after changing / checking those settings!
